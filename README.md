+You absolutly need to already create a save before to don't get any bug (the save don't need to be played in, just create it moove a bit get to 
the first bench in the main city and it's good you can leave and replace it.)

+If you leave godhome, everything that is happening outside of it ain't my responsability you might get blocked or don't have acces to certain places

+My discord is TMC_yoan you can contact me or ask me something if you have a bug or need help or a certain type of save you are intersted in i can 
work for it :D

+You can keep your first save in an other document you create to not loose it if you wan't to, but don't be shocked if you loose it because it's 
easily corrupted :/


Finaly Thanks to Bloodorca with he's site that can let us code the save of Hollow Knight dodging the crypted version
